# my dotfiles and configs
clone this repo and you can use them too!

## for the noobs 
1. clone this script on any linux distro using(in the terminal):
`git clone https://github.com/dj1ch/configs.git`
2. open the file app and find the folder named `configs`
3. in that folder, you can find other files in other folders, which are the dotfiles you will need.
### How do I use them?
- you can copy the dotfiles from the `dotfiles` folder, and put them into your home directory(`/home/<your username>`)
- they should apply as long as the program is installed
- however, for the configs put the files in their required config directory(most of the time it is in `~/.config`)
